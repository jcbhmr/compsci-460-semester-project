# SpeedCompare

ðŸ’» Basic network speed testing client & server scripts in Python

## Installation

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/jcbhmr/speedcompare.git
```

## Usage

<table><td>

```sh
speedcompare-server tcp
```

<td>

```sh
speedcompare tcp
```

</table>

### How it works

You choose the amount of data to send from the server to the client. When a new client connects to the server it immediately sends that many bytes. The client then can check how long it took to receive the data and calculate the speed.

## Results

### UDP

All of these tests were run from localhost to localhost. There was no external network involved.

| Sockets | Loop delay | Data | Time | Speed | Percent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 ms | 10 MB | 1.02 s | 4.46 Mbps | 5.73% |
| 1 | 1 ms | 10 MB | 3.02 s | 25.51 Mbps | 96.54% |

Things I noticed:

- It's almost like the UDP server is sending the data _too fast_ and it just gets skipped over. For instance when you introduce a 1ms delay in the `send(4096 bytes)` loop the percent of data received goes up quite drastically!
